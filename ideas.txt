#dispatch-log - automatically generate log entries using VRC locations of the squadmembers.
  Use the location with the greatest number of squadmembers in it (just in case the squad is split).
  Automatically insert Squad name, Location, and Backup Required type (specified as an argument to the command).
  
  
Online Dispatch Portal - have a #dispatch-bot-channel to request a one-time password from the bot (must have dispatch role to view channel)
  Automatically populate lists in the portal with officers in VCs, as well as Squad locations. Dispatch Portal should allow Dispatch to send
  invites to a squad to bring them into the same world as a squad in need of support. Dispatch Portal should have the ability to create a
  dispatch log for a squad. Perhaps in the future, implement integration with Discord's login, allowing users to login to the Portal using their
  Discord account, assuming they have the Dispatch role.
  
#mugshots - use recent worlds of the squad making the arrest to determine what world an arrest was made in. User menus.py to ask the arresting
  officer if the bot has the correct world, and log it in a database. We can use this to get statistics on which worlds give good interactions,
  and which Officers prefer which worlds.
